## Introduction
My knowledge about frontend technologies was a bit outdated, because I use JSF at work. That's why in September 2020 I thought it is time to learn something new. I decided to go with Angular and found a nice course about Angular on Udemy.

The course is called **Angular - The Complete Guide (2021 Edition)** from the fantastic Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. You can find the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/).  
It is parted in theoretic lessons and a course project, where one can apply the learned things in practise.

Since September 2020 I have been working on the course every now and then and, because yesterday I created a GitHub account, I thought why not show the world my progress.   
**This repository contains my own version of the course project, which I coded along the course videos.**
 
 At the moment the UI looks like this:
